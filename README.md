# Movie Booking System - OOAD Project, 2024
## Problem Statement
The traditional method of movie ticket booking often involves physically visiting a theatre, waiting in line, and potentially facing limited showtime information. This can be inconvenient and time-consuming for customers.
This project aims to develop a user-friendly online movie booking system built in Java that addresses these shortcomings by providing the following functionalities:
- User access: Allow users to register, login, and manage their accounts.
- Movie browsing: Enable users to browse through a comprehensive list of movies, including details like titles, genres, cast, and synopses.
- Showtime selection: Facilitate searching for showtimes based on movie title, theatre location, and preferred date/time.
- Seat selection: Provide a user-friendly interface for selecting available seats within the chosen showtime.
- Payment processing: Integrate a secure payment gateway for users to conveniently purchase tickets using various payment methods.
- Booking confirmation: Offer a confirmation system with e-tickets or booking references for users to access their purchased tickets.
