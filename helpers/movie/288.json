This pro shot DVD from a night at Jones Beach captures Page and the band delivering  a number of high-class Led Zeppelin classics, among them 'Celebration Day', 'The Lemon Song', 'Heartbreaker', and 'Whole Lotta Love', as well as numbers that nobody would have expected. Tracks like 'Ten Years Gone', 'Your Time Is Gonna Come' or 'What Is And What Should Never Be' were convincingly delivered thanks to Page and the two Crowes guitarists Rich Robinson and Audley Freed, who not only have the necessary technique but also the right feeling for this kind of material. Chris Robinson delivers an unbelievably powerful and dramatic vocal performance.","popularity":0.988,"poster_path":"/8SkDQsY4Zz4C39mvudt5DGh1ScI.jpg","release_date":"2000-07-10","title":"Jimmy Page \u0026 The Black Crowes - Live at Jones Beach","video":true,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[10752],"id":396274,"original_language":"it","original_title":"Rangers: attacco ora X","overview":"A special forces operative is smuggled into a German POW camp with orders to blow up a nearby villa being used by the Nazis to house a secret weapons program.","popularity":2.246,"poster_path":"/pIZpc2GZ2J0DPNGOzCFl0Psmc0Y.jpg","release_date":"1970-02-26","title":"Rangers Attack at Hour X","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[18],"id":649086,"original_language":"it","original_title":"Paola makes a wish","overview":"On her regular day at work, Paola starts to feel that she is missing out something exciting.","popularity":1.773,"poster_path":"/5czN4K6HES5qtKV01PLdNxFyhE9.jpg","release_date":"2019-08-16","title":"Paola makes a wish","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/kkyANPpchrMfbBHFQGH5g60SfO6.jpg","genre_ids":[99],"id":70774,"original_language":"fr","original_title":"Il était une fois...
