These are the people you see representing Rohani in the film at various stages in his life. Story telling is a big part of Bajau culture, and a way of preserving traditions through generations, so everyone was very enthusiastic about what we were trying to do and brought lots of ideas of their own, especially Rohani. Although he had never had a camera pointed at him, it certainly wasn’t the first time he’d sat around telling stories. We were just lucky that he let us capture it on film.","popularity":1.842,"poster_path":"/fURZxyednytT8BdEZyIVZCqxZvB.jpg","release_date":"2015-09-24","title":"Jago: A Life Underwater","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":25},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/Awi5tUs4fAzRoB8voY1JWf4IYCM.jpg","genre_ids":[18,9648,53],"id":43642,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Abandoned","overview":"Mary Walsh delivers boyfriend Kevin to a hospital for routine outpatient surgery.
