The most important message that I want the film to convey is that everything is possible and home is not a place on a map, but a place in the soul of each person that I spoke to. The unconventional way of showing many people as one is not just a way of making the film more convenient to create, but a way to fit a much information into one consistent image, that the audience is more likely to understand and perceive as the author intended it.  My own experience blended in with the experiences of others.","popularity":1.015,"poster_path":"/7KEwncDftMwObekXgWBjBEc8vEp.jpg","release_date":"2024-01-16","title":"An Untitled Film by George Alshevskij-Jones","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[878,10749],"id":88110,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Emmanuelle in Space 5: A Time to Dream","overview":"Emmanuelle teaches her alien friends to explore sexual fantasy through their dreams, and searches for her own dream lover.","popularity":20.293,"poster_path":"/n95miAa1KQFD47IKYRrrfvBbyl8.jpg","release_date":"1994-10-09","title":"Emmanuelle in Space 5: A Time to Dream","video":false,"vote_average":4.778,"vote_count":9},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/zVBsGrA8MIx7DNeo33Ll86dKzZU.jpg","genre_ids":[35,18],"id":529862,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Brittany Runs a Marathon","overview":"Hilarious and outgoing, Brittany Forgler, is everybody’s best friend ― except her own.
