The film transitions to fiction in a second act freely adapted from a Pirandello play. A man with a flower-shaped tumour on his lip accosts a traveller in an all-night caf√©. Their seemingly mundane conversation becomes a metaphysical monologue as the man, feeling death approach, clings to life by scrupulously observing its activity, watching reality in every detail, as if to fill the gap between himself and the rest of the world.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/jWye42Xf92c9rDi70h9jZlpXHJA.jpg","release_date":"2022-02-16","title":"A Flower in the Mouth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/hlo3hwjk52ffBuUxloCcO9x0rak.jpg","genre_ids":[9648,53,27,36],"id":376464,"original_language":"it","original_title":"L'isola dell'angelo caduto","overview":"In 1924, a young police commissioner is relocated to a small island near Sicily.
