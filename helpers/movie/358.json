This is by far not an easy task. In addition to the searing grief, dying also brings a number of tasks that are at once utterly alien and intensely time-critical.

Overnight, the young girl has to become a skilful organiser of a family event, while also being a specialist on coffins, urns, wreaths and funeral feasts. Dovile’s journey towards organising a perfect funeral is inevitably full of hardship and mishaps, accompanied mainly by black humour and comical situations.","popularity":2.122,"poster_path":"/tEQEf5zM5al5gdy4d1KTkkzpdBM.jpg","release_date":"2021-11-24","title":"Feature Film About Life","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":5},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/3yCRAFt5zUP0Yzna1Sa3u8KD0xk.jpg","genre_ids":[35,10402,10749,10770],"id":366018,"original_language":"en","original_title":"A Christmas Melody","overview":"Kristin has just had to close her small Manhattan clothing boutique to return to her Ohio home town and live in her parents' former home.
