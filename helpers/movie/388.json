He lives as a hermit on the holy mountain. Not all monks, however, live as secluded and demure as Father Galaktion. The film team is also received by Father Epiphanios - a gifted and poetic cook who certainly does not disdain the pleasures of life.","popularity":2.038,"poster_path":"/jRwev7xhpQHzEjfWApJ4Wwtl4xR.jpg","release_date":"2016-06-23","title":"Athos","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":8},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[35],"id":96215,"original_language":"es","original_title":"Adulterio nacional","overview":"A man falls in love with his friend's wife and plots the different ways to get rid of his current wife and also his friend so he can have his new found love all to himself.","popularity":4.239,"poster_path":"/yWmMKDY60LqoLHWsG6coAFC0LOu.jpg","release_date":"1982-05-24","title":"National Adultery","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":2},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/5CGyIlRmmbAV5YuREgUaX1czjnL.jpg","genre_ids":[35],"id":95753,"original_language":"pt","original_title":"As Aventuras de Agamenon, o Repórter","overview":"The trajectory of the clumsy reporter Agamenon Mendes Pereira, always present in key events of history, his biggest scoops and his eternal love for Isaura, who survives his unexpected travels around the world, in search of news and fame.","popularity":1.768,"poster_path":"/sA7eFsHAdlSwdqtbxuATV9QaOiL.jpg","release_date":"2012-01-06","title":"Agamenon: The Film","video":false,"vote_average":1.974,"vote_count":19}],"total_pages":500,"total_results":10000}
